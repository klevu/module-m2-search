We only support installation via Composer.
Klevu 4.0.0-BETA-1 is released with the stability of Beta.  
Therefore, to install with composer the stability flag is required.
```shell
composer require "klevu/module-m2-search:4.0.0@beta"
```
Note: It is not possible to install `2.x/3.x` and `4.x` at the same time. 
Any attempt to install `4.x` while `2.x/3.x` is installed will fail and display a warning message. 
i.e. running `composer require klevu/module-m2-search` before running `composer remove "klevu/*"` will fail.
